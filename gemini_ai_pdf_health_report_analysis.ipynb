            "\n",
            "**Widal Test:** This test checks for antibodies against *Salmonella Typhi* and *Salmonella Paratyphi*, bacteria that cause typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever.  The numbers (e.g., 1:160) represent the dilution of the sample at which antibodies were still detected.  Higher numbers suggest a higher likelihood of infection.  In this case, the results suggest a past exposure to *Salmonella Typhi* (\"O\" and \"H\" antigens) but not a current infection.  The *Salmonella Paratyphi* results are within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Dengue Serology:** This test screens for dengue fever, a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.  NS1 antigen, IgG, and IgM are all components checked for in detecting the virus.  All three tests are negative, meaning no evidence of current or recent dengue infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate):** This measures how quickly red blood cells settle in a test tube. A faster rate (higher mm/hr) can indicate inflammation or infection in the body.  The results show elevated ESR, suggesting some level of inflammation.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Rapid Malaria Test:** This test checks for the presence of malaria parasites in the blood. Both *Plasmodium vivax* (P.V.) and *Plasmodium falciparum* (P.F.) tests are negative, indicating no malaria infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Complete Blood Picture (CBC):** This is a comprehensive blood test that includes:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Hemoglobin (Hb):** Measures the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood.  Mr. Goud's level is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Red Blood Cells (RBC):** Counts the number of red blood cells. His count is slightly below the lower limit of the normal range.\n",
            "* **White Blood Cells (WBC):** Counts the number of white blood cells (part of the immune system). His count is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Platelets:** These cells help with blood clotting. His count is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **PCV (Packed Cell Volume):** Measures the percentage of red blood cells in the blood. His value is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Differential Count:** This breaks down the types of white blood cells present.  All are within normal ranges.\n",
            "* **Peripheral Blood Smear:** A microscopic examination of the blood sample.  The description indicates normal red and white blood cell morphology and adequate platelets.\n",
            "\n",
            "**HbA1c:**  This test measures average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months.  Mr. Goud's level (5.4%) falls within the normal range for someone without diabetes.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Serum Creatinine:** This measures creatinine, a waste product from muscle breakdown, in the blood.  It's used to assess kidney function.  His level is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Random Blood Glucose:** Measures blood sugar at a random time. His level is within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Liver Function Test (LFT):** This group of tests assesses liver health:\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Bilirubin (Total, Direct, Indirect):** Bilirubin is a byproduct of red blood cell breakdown.  All three are within normal ranges, indicating normal liver function.\n",
            "* **Alkaline Phosphatase:** An enzyme found in the liver and bones. His level is within the normal range.\n",
            "* **SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT):** Liver enzymes. His levels are within the normal range.\n",
            "* **Total Protein and Albumin:** Proteins in the blood.  Both are within normal ranges.\n",
            "* **Globulin:** Another blood protein. The Albumin/Globulin ratio (A/G ratio) is also within the normal range.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Serum Electrolytes:** This measures levels of essential minerals in the blood:\n",

Most of his blood work is within normal limits.
