            "* **`sorted()` vs. `list.sort()`:**  The code clearly demonstrates the difference between `sorted()` (which returns a *new* sorted list) and `list.sort()` (which sorts the original list *in place*).  This is a very common point of confusion for beginners.  The example shows both approaches.\n",
            "\n",
            "* **Example Usage for Each Function:**  Each function is accompanied by example usage code with comments explaining the output. This makes it easy for the user to understand how to use the function and what to expect.\n",

            "* **Sorting in Descending Order:**  Includes an example using `reverse=True` to sort in descending order.\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Sorting a List of Tuples:**  Provides a complete example of sorting a list of tuples, with clear explanations on how to specify the index to sort by.  Uses a `lambda` function for a concise key.\n",

            "    * Sorting a list in place (modifying the original).\n",

            "\n",
            "* **Error Handling (Implicit):** The built-in `sorted()` function and `list.sort()` methods handle many common error conditions gracefully.  For example, if you try to sort a list containing elements of incompatible types (e.g., numbers and strings) without a custom `key`, you'll get a `TypeError`.  Explicit error handling (try-except blocks) can be added if you need to handle specific potential errors, but for basic sorting, it's often not necessary.\n",

These abilities emerge as a result of their scale and the way they are trained. Examples include few-shot learning (learning from only a few examples), common-sense reasoning, and even rudimentary code generation.\n",
